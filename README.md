# Villagers
### A management idle game

### !!! VERY ALPHA STAGE !!!

#### DONE
- Init system (random generation of raw materials and a minimun number of starting villagers)
- Simple daytime loop (24 hours and day)
- Base raw material consuming on day passing (actually only for food and wood)
- Base cooldown system for material gathering (you are forced to wait after searching for a raw material)
- Base random system for raw material research (you can't find the same quantity every time, maybe sometime you can find nothing... it's life)
- Save and load system (you need to save manually every time, after that the first time you fire up the game the system load the last state saved)
- New game to delete the save state

### TO DO
- Better randomization
- Implement seasons and climate changes
- Random events (good and worst)
- Life cycle of villagers with a sort of experience that gradually grows or go down
